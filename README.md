# Face Recognition with Anti-Spoofing 

A dual-model face recognition system designed for secure and accurate identity verification. This project separates **Identity Recognition** and **Anti-Spoofing Detection** for enhanced safety and modular design.

## Features

-  **Face Identity Recognition** using deep learning
-  **Liveness Detection** to prevent spoof attacks (photos, videos, masks)
-  Modular and easy to upgrade
-  Custom pre-processing pipeline for real-world data
-  Clean data storage and handling
-  Training-ready with clean logs and metrics
